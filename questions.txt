1.  The usuage of something like stdint.h is to define specifically how many bits a data type is going to take up. When implementing
    a program across different types of computers, some will use one architecture (such as 32-bit) while others will use another (64-bit).
    By defining exactly how many bits should be used for a data type, we avoid the computer on which the program is run changing the number of bits
    associated with our data type.
2.  Using things such as uint8_t define the exact number of bits that the type defined after that should use. 
3.  BYTE = 1, DWORD = 4, LONG = 4, and WORD = 2.
4.  The letters BM in ASCII are used to identify a BITMAP file. 
5.  bfSize refers to the size in bytes of the BMP file in relation to other meta-data, while biSize refers to the bytes required for the 
    data structure of the BMP.
6.  If biHeight is negative, then the BMP image is read from the top down, starting in the upper, left-hand corner. 
7.  biColor
8.  fopen might return NULL if the file is not found.
9.  We only want to read the number of bytes defined in the 2nd argument once, which is why 1 is always used for the third argument that
    specifies the number of blocks of bytes to read at a time. 
10. 0
11. fseek moves the file pointer to a different location in the file, based on the input passed to it.
12. SEEK_CUR tells fseek to move the file pointer in relation to its current position.
