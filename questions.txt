0.  :  a pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of very fine silicate or quartz dust
1.  getrusage stores the resource usage statistics for the calling process
2.  16
3.  Passing by reference avoids having to copy the data to the stack, and take up potentially unavailable memory.
    In short, it's more effecient.
4.  Main reads words by iterating, char by char, through the file passed in. If the char it's looking at (indicated
    by c) is an alphabetical letter, or if it happens to be an apostrophe, that char is stored at the end of the word
    in the variable WORD at position INDEX. Should the index ever become larger than the constant LENGTH, main will skip
    past the rest of the word. If the char looked at is a number, again main will skip past the rest of the word. If
    the char is not a letter, and not a number, the assumption is a word has been completed, and main goes on to check
    if that word is stored in the dictionary. 
5.  fscanf could potentially pick up numbers, or a word that is beyond the length of what we are capable of dealing with.
6.  The variables were declared as constants to avoid the value passed via the pointer from being changed. Constant
    tells the computer not to try changing the value pointed to. It would appear it's an extra level of safety in case
    the programmer accidentally writes a function that tries to manipulate the value pointed to.
